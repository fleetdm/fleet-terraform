# Fleet CloudWatch Log Group Sharing (Source Account)

## Usage

Use this module in the source Fleet account (and in the same region as the Fleet CloudWatch log group).

### Firehose destination (default)

```hcl
module "fleet_log_sharing" {
  source = "github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform//addons/byo-cloudwatch-log-sharing/cloudwatch?depth=1&ref=tf-mod-addon-byo-cloudwatch-log-sharing-v1.0.0"

  subscription = {
    log_group_name  = module.fleet.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.logging_config["awslogs-group"]
    destination_arn = "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:222222222222:destination:fleet-app-logs-firehose"
    # destination_type defaults to "firehose"
    filter_pattern = ""
  }
}
```

### Kinesis destination

```hcl
module "fleet_log_sharing" {
  source = "github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform//addons/byo-cloudwatch-log-sharing/cloudwatch?depth=1&ref=tf-mod-addon-byo-cloudwatch-log-sharing-v1.0.0"

  subscription = {
    log_group_name       = module.fleet.byo-vpc.byo-db.byo-ecs.logging_config["awslogs-group"]
    destination_arn      = "arn:aws:logs:us-east-2:222222222222:destination:fleet-app-logs-kinesis"
    destination_type     = "kinesis"
    kinesis_distribution = "ByLogStream"
    filter_pattern       = ""
  }
}
```

`subscription.destination_arn` is usually provided out-of-band by the organization that runs the target-account module in their environment.

No Fleet environment variable changes are required. This module configures the CloudWatch Logs subscription directly on the Fleet log group.
