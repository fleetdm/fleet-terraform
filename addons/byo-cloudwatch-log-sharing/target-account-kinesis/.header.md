# Fleet CloudWatch Log Group Sharing via Kinesis (Target Account)

This module creates the cross-account CloudWatch Logs destination and a Kinesis Data Stream target.

Because CloudWatch Logs destinations must be created in the same region as the source log group, this module uses two provider aliases:

- `aws.destination`: Region of the Fleet CloudWatch log group (source region).
- `aws.target`: Region for the Kinesis stream (same region or different region).

Both provider aliases must use the same AWS account credentials. Cross-account is achieved between source and target subscriptions, not between `aws.destination` and `aws.target` within this module.

## Usage

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "source_region"
  region = "us-east-2"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "target_region"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

module "fleet_log_sharing_target" {
  source = "github.com/fleetdm/fleet-terraform//addons/byo-cloudwatch-log-sharing/target-account-kinesis?depth=1&ref=tf-mod-addon-byo-cloudwatch-log-sharing-v1.0.0"

  providers = {
    aws.destination = aws.source_region
    aws.target      = aws.target_region
  }

  source_account_ids = ["111111111111"]

  cloudwatch_destination = {
    name        = "fleet-app-logs"
    role_name   = "fleet-app-logs-role"
    policy_name = "fleet-app-logs-policy"
  }

  kinesis = {
    stream_name = "fleet-app-logs"
  }
}

output "fleet_log_sharing_target" {
  value = module.fleet_log_sharing_target
}
```

Then apply the source account module (`../cloudwatch`) using `module.fleet_log_sharing_target.log_destination.arn` and set `destination_type = "kinesis"`.
